        <p>I¬¥m Nina, 22 years old and study "Art and Multimedia" in my first semster at LMU Munich.</p>
        <p>In my free time I dance with the Perchalla carnival company.</p>
        <p>I also do volunteer work, I look after young people and teach them how to lead groups.
        Aside from that I¬¥m at UniKult and take care of the design there.</p>

        <h3>Server, Hosting and Development</h3>
        <img src="pictures/7.SHD-Bild1.png" alt="SHD-Bild1" style="height: 250px; float: right">
        <p>A <b>server</b> is a computer or software application that provides services or resources
          to other computers, known as clients, within a network. <br><br>
          <b>Hosting</b> refers to the service of providing the infrastructure, resources and environment
          for a website, application or service to be accessible on the internet. Web hosting <b>companies</b>
          offer server space and support for individuals or organizations to <b>store</b> their <b>website files,
          databases and other assets.</b><br><br>
          <b>Deployment</b> is the process of making a software application or system available for use
          </p>
        <p><b><u>Server-side versus client-side code</u></b></p>
        <p><b>Client-side</b> code is code that is run on the user's computer ‚Äî when a web page is viewed, the page's <br>
          client-side code is downloaded, then run and displayed by the browser.<br><br>
          <b>Server-side</b> code on the other hand is run on the server, then its results are downloaded <br>
          and displayed in the browser.
          </p>

        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>Elaborate a study-case related to the listed programming languages, considering: <b>syntax, 
          learning curve, platform support, performance, industry adoption ‚Ä¶</b></p>
        <u>Using Python as an example:</u> <br> 
        <ul>
          <li><b>Syntax:</b> comand line or python file on server</li>
          <li><b>Learning curve:</b> easy to learn, but hard to master</li>
          <li><b>Platform support:</b> Linux, Windows 8, macOS 10.6, FreeBSD10</li>
          <li><b>Performance:</b> slow performance, because it is an interpreted language 
            (perhaps will get faster)</li>
          <li><b>Industry adaption:</b> Web development -> because object oriented programming language 
            (processing of data and abjects in software), data science and data analysis, machine learning, 
            startups, finance industry</li>
          <li><b>Price:</b> free to download and use</li>
          <li><b>Extensible:</b> with C++ (compatibility with other languages)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Backend programming</h3>
        <p><b>Node.js</b> is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code server-side. <br>
          It is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, the same engine that powers the Google Chrome browser. <br><br>
          IDE: Integrated Development Environment<br><br>
          VSCODE
          </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Data Storage and Databases</h3>
        <b>Data storage</b> refers to the process of storing digital data in a structured manner for future 
        retrieval and use. It involves using various technologies and systems to store, organize and manage 
        data in a way that allows for efficient access and retrieval. Data storage solutions can range from 
        simple file systems to complex databases and cloud storage services, each offering different 
        capabilities, scalability and levels of reliability. The goal of data storage is to preserve 
        information securely and make it readily available when needed.
        <br><br>
        <b>Databases</b> are organized collections of structured data stored electronically in a 
        computer system. They are designed to efficiently manage, store and retrieve large volumes of 
        data while providing mechanisms for data manipulation, querying and security. Databases typically 
        consist of tables with rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column 
        represents an attribute or field of the data. Databases play a critical role in storing and 
        organizing data for various applications, ranging from simple personal databases to large-scale 
        enterprise systems.
