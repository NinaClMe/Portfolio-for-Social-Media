        <h3>Frontend development definitions</h3>
        <p>Frontend development, often simply referred to as "front-end," is a discipline in <b>web</b> and <br>
          <b>software</b> development that focuses on creating the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) <br> 
          of a <b>website</b> or <b>application.</b> The primary goal of frontend development is to ensure that the application <br>
          or website is <b>visually appealing, responsive and user-friendly.</b> Frontend developers work on <br> 
          the client side of web development, which means they deal with what users see and interact <br>
          with in their browsers or on their devices.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Good UI/UX</h3>
        <p>A good user interface (UI) refers to the <b>visual and interactive aspects of a product,</b> whether <br> 
          it's a website, application or any other software. A UI is considered good when it effectively <br>
          presents information and functionality to the user in an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly manner. <br><br> 
          User experience encompasses the broader, holistic experience a user has with a product, <br>
          including their emotional and practical interactions. A good user experience focuses on making <br>
          the <b>entire interaction</b> as positive and efficient as possible. It includes the UI but extends beyond it.
          </p>

        <h3>Key Technologies (web development)</h3>
        <p><u>Web pages are composed by:</u></p>
        <ol>
          <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring content</li>
          <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout</li>
          <li>JavaScript for adding interactivity</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>HTML or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure 
          content on the World Wide Web. It provides a set of elements or tags that are used to define the 
          structure of a web page, including headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, forms and other elements.
          <br><br>
          <u>Key features and concepts of HTML:</u>
          <br>
          <b>Tags:</b> HTML uses tags to define elements within a document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and 
          most have opening and closing tags to enclose content. For example, "p" and "/p" define the start and 
          end of a paragraph, respectively.
          <br><br>
          <b>Attributes:</b> HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element. 
          Attributes are included within the opening tag and typically consist of a name and a value. 
          For example, "img src="image.jpg" alt="Description"" includes the src and alt attributes for an image.
          <br><br>
          <b>Document Structure:</b> HTML documents have a specific structure, including a "head" section for metadata 
          (title, links to stylesheets, etc.) and a "body" section for the main content of the document.
          <br><br>
          <b>Hyperlinks:</b> HTML allows the creation of hyperlinks using the "a" (anchor) element. Hyperlinks enable 
          navigation between different web pages or resources.
          <br><br>
          <b>Lists:</b> HTML supports ordered lists ("ol"), unordered lists ("ul") and definition lists ("dl") to organize
          content into lists.
          <br><br>
          <b>Forms:</b> HTML includes form elements ("form", "input", "select", etc.) for creating interactive input forms 
          on web pages.
          <br><br>
          HTML is complemented by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, which are used for styling and 
          adding interactivity to web pages, respectively. Together, HTML, CSS and JavaScript form the foundation 
          of modern web development, allowing developers to create dynamic and visually appealing websites.</p>

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used in web development to describe the 
          presentation and layout of HTML or XML documents. CSS enables developers to control the appearance of 
          web pages, including the styling of elements such as text, fonts, colors, spacing and positioning.
          <br><br>
          <u>Key features and concepts of CSS:</u>
          <br>
          <b>Selectors:</b> CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements within a document. Selectors can be based on 
          element types, classes, IDs, attributes or other criteria.
          <br><br>
          <b>Properties:</b> Properties define the visual aspects of HTML elements, such as color, font size, margin, 
          padding and more. Each property has a corresponding value that determines the specific styling.
          <br><br>
          <b>Declaration Blocks:</b> Declarations consist of property-value pairs and are grouped within curly 
          braces to form a declaration block. Multiple declaration blocks can be combined to apply styles 
          to different selectors.
          <br><br>
          <b>Cascading:</b> The term "cascading" in CSS refers to the process of combining styles from different 
          sources, including user styles, author styles and browser defaults. The styles are applied based 
          on specificity and order of precedence.
          <br><br>
          <b>External, Internal and Inline Styles:</b> CSS can be applied externally through a separate stylesheet 
          file linked to the HTML document, internally within the HTML document using a "style" element or 
          inline directly within HTML tags using the style attribute.
          <br><br>
          CSS is an essential part of modern web development, allowing developers to separate the structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS) of a web page. It provides flexibility, maintainability and consistency in designing visually appealing and responsive websites.</p>
