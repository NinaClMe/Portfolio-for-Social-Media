        <h3>Application Programming Interfaces - APIs</h3>
        <img src="pictures/6.APIs.png" alt="APIs" style="height: 400px; float: right;">
        <p> An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different 
          software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that 
          applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs are fundamental in enabling the 
          integration of different systems, services and applications.
          <br><br>
          <b>Endpoints:</b> An API consists of endpoints, which are specific URLs or URIs (Uniform Resource 
          Identifiers) that applications can use to interact with the API. Each endpoint represents a specific 
          functionality or resource provided by the API.
          <br><br>
          <b>HTTP Methods:</b> APIs often use standard HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, to 
          define the type of operation to be performed on a resource. For example, a GET request might retrieve 
          data, while a POST request might create a new resource.
          <br><br>
          <b>Request and Response:</b> API communication involves sending requests from a client (requesting 
          application) to a server (providing application) and receiving responses. Requests contain 
          information like the method, endpoint and sometimes data, while responses include the requested 
          data or an indication of the operation's success or failure.
          <br><br>
          <b>Authentication:</b> APIs often require authentication to ensure that only authorized users or 
          applications can access the provided resources. Common authentication mechanisms include API keys, 
          OAuth tokens and username/password combinations.
          <br><br>
          <b>Data Formats:</b> APIs use specific data formats to structure information in requests and 
          responses. Common formats include JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language).
          <br><br>
          <b>Rate Limiting:</b> To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage, APIs may implement rate limiting, 
          restricting the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame.
          <br><br>
          <b>Documentation:</b> API documentation is essential for developers to understand how to use the API, 
          including available endpoints, required parameters, authentication methods and response formats.
          <br><br>
          <b><u>Types of APIs:</u></b>
          <br>
          <b>Web APIs (RESTful APIs):</b> Web APIs, often based on REST (Representational State Transfer) 
          principles, use standard HTTP methods and are widely used for web development. They provide a 
          stateless communication model.
          <br>
          <b>SOAP APIs:</b> Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) APIs use XML for message formatting and 
          are known for their strict standards and protocol.
          <br>
          <b>GraphQL APIs:</b> GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to 
          request exactly the data they need.
          <br><br>
          APIs are crucial for building interconnected and interoperable systems. They facilitate the 
          development of third-party integrations, mobile app connections and the creation of composite 
          applications by leveraging the functionalities of existing software or services.</p>

        <h3>Backend development</h3>
        <p>Backend development involves designing, building and maintaining the <b>server-side logic, <br>
          databases,</b> and application <b>infrastructure</b> that empower the <b>functionality</b> and 
          <b>data management</b> <br> of web and mobile applications.
        </p>
        <p>It refers to the server-side of web development, where the logic, databases and server 
          take care of the functionalities that happen behind the scenes. <br>
          Here are some of the main components:
          <br><br>
          <b>Server:</b> This is essentially a powerful computer that stores the data and serves it to clients 
          upon request. It runs the backend application, receiving and processing requests.
          <br><br>
          <b>Database:</b> Information needs to be stored somewhere. The database is where data is organized and 
          retrieved. There are various types of databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
          <br><br>
          <b>Application Logic:</b> This is the core of the backend. It contains the code responsible for handling
          requests, processing data and interacting with the database. It often involves programming languages 
          like Python, Ruby, Java or Node.js.
          <br><br>
          <b>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):</b> These are the means by which the frontend and backend 
          communicate. The backend provides a set of APIs that the frontend can call to request or send data.
          <br><br>
          <b>Authentication and Authorization:</b> Backend systems often involve user data. So, there's a need 
          for mechanisms to authenticate (verify the identity) and authorize (grant or deny access) users.
          <br><br>
          <b>Security:</b> Ensuring the security of data and the backend system is crucial. This involves 
          encryption, secure protocols and protecting against common web vulnerabilities.
          <br><br>
          Backend development is essentially about making sure the server, database and application work 
          seamlessly to provide the desired functionality. It's like the engine of a car, it's the powerhouse 
          that makes everything run smoothly.</p>
