        <p><b>Client / Server architecture</b></p>
        <p>It is a computing model that describes the relationship between two types of devices or programs: 
          clients and servers. <br>This architecture is widely used in computer networks and distributed systems. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Client / Server infrastructure</b></p>
        <p>The client-server architecture relies on a complex infrastructure to enable communication between 
          clients and servers. <br>This infrastructure includes various components and technologies that support 
          the functioning of the architecture.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Client / Server architecture</h3>
        <img src="pictures/2.Client_Server Architecture.png" alt="CSa-Bild" style="height: 190px; float: right">
        <p>Client/Server architecture is a computing model that divides software applications into two distinct 
          roles or entities: the client and the server. This model is commonly used in networked systems where 
          multiple devices need to communicate and collaborate.
          <br><br>
          <u>Key characteristics of Client/Server architecture:</u>
          <br>
          <b>Client:</b> The client is a user interface or application that interacts with the user. It requests services 
          or resources from the server and handles the presentation and user input. Clients can be desktop 
          applications, web browsers, mobile apps or any device or software that initiates communication.
          <br><br>
          <b>Server:</b> The server is a central system that provides resources, services or data to clients. It 
          processes client requests, performs the required operations and returns the results to the clients. 
          Servers can handle multiple client requests concurrently and manage shared resources.
          <br><br>
          <b>Communication:</b> Clients and servers communicate over a network, typically using protocols such as HTTP, 
          TCP/IP or others. The client sends requests to the server and the server responds with the requested 
          data or services.
          <br><br>
          <b>Decentralized Processing:</b> In a client/server architecture, processing tasks are distributed between the 
          client and server. The server typically handles resource-intensive operations, data storage and 
          business logic, while the client manages the user interface and user interactions.
          <br><br>
          <b>Scalability:</b> Client/Server architecture allows for scalability, as additional clients can connect to the 
          server without affecting the overall structure. Scaling can involve increasing server capacity or 
          distributing services across multiple servers.
          <br><br>
          Examples of client/server applications include web browsers (clients) interacting with web servers, 
          email clients fetching messages from email servers and database clients querying data from database 
          servers. This architecture provides a modular and efficient approach to designing distributed systems,
          allowing for better resource management, flexibility and ease of maintenance.</p>

        <h3>Client / Server infrastructure</h3>
        <img src="pictures/2.Client_Server Infrastrucutre.png" alt="CSi-Bild" style="height: 350px; float: right">
        <p>Client/Server infrastructure refers to a network architecture in which computing resources and tasks 
          are divided between client devices and server systems. This infrastructure model enables efficient 
          sharing of resources, centralized management and distributed processing in a networked environment.
          <br><br>
          <u>Key components and characteristics of Client/Server infrastructure:</u>
          <br>
          <b>Clients:</b> These are end-user devices, such as computers, laptops, tablets or smartphones, that 
          interact with the user and initiate requests for services or resources. Clients typically run 
          applications and user interfaces, handling presentation and user input.
          <br><br>
          <b>Servers:</b> Servers are powerful computers or systems that provide services, resources or data to 
          clients. They perform processing, data storage and manage shared resources. Servers respond to client 
          requests, execute requested operations and send results back to the clients.
          <br><br>
          <b>Network:</b> The communication between clients and servers occurs over a network, which can be a 
          local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN) or the internet. Protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP 
          or others facilitate the exchange of data between clients and servers.
          <br><br>
          <b>Decentralized Processing:</b> In a Client/Server infrastructure, processing tasks are distributed 
          between clients and servers based on their capabilities. Clients handle user interactions and 
          presentation, while servers manage resource-intensive operations and data processing.
          <br><br>
          <b>Scalability:</b> Client/Server infrastructure is scalable, allowing for the addition of more clients 
          without significantly affecting the overall system. Scaling can also involve increasing server capacity, 
          distributing services across multiple servers or introducing load balancing.
          <br><br>
          Examples of Client/Server infrastructure implementations include web-based applications, where web 
          browsers (clients) interact with web servers; email systems, where email clients communicate with 
          email servers; and database systems, where clients query data from database servers.
          <br><br>
          This architecture provides a modular and efficient framework for designing and managing networked 
          systems, facilitating collaboration, resource sharing and centralized control.</p>

                of the Internet Protocol suite and is responsible for addressing and routing packets so that 
                they can travel across different networks and reach their intended destination.
                <br>
                IP provides a unique address, called an IP address, to each device connected to a network, 
                allowing for the identification and communication between devices. There are two main versions 
                of IP: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6). IPv4 addresses 
                are composed of 32 bits, while IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, providing a much larger address

                Routers are network devices that operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI (Open Systems 
                Interconnection) model. Their primary function is to forward data packets between different 
                computer networks, making decisions based on the destination IP addresses of the packets. 
                Routers play a crucial role in directing traffic on the internet and other networks, ensuring 
                that data reaches its intended destination efficiently.
                <br>
                These devices maintain routing tables, which contain information about the available paths and 
                network topology. Routers use this information to determine the best path for data packets to 
                reach their destination. In addition to packet forwarding, routers can perform other functions, 
                such as network address translation (NAT), firewalling and providing security features. 
                They play a key role in connecting different segments of a network and facilitating communication
