              <td><b>Relational Databases</b></td>
              <td><b>Relational databases</b> are a type of database management system (DBMS) that organizes and 
                stores data in tables with predefined relationships between them. These databases follow 
                the principles of relational algebra and are based on the relational model proposed by Edgar Codd. 
                In a relational database, data is structured into tables, each consisting of rows and columns.
                <br><br>
                <u>Key characteristics of relational databases:</u>
                <br>
                <b>Tables:</b> Data is organized into tables, where each table represents a specific entity or 
                concept. Each row in a table corresponds to a specific record and each column represents a 
                particular attribute of the data.
                <br><br>
                <b>Relationships:</b> Tables can be related to each other using common fields, allowing for the 
                establishment of relationships between different entities. This relational structure enables 
                efficient data retrieval and maintenance.
                <br><br>
                <b>Constraints:</b> Relational databases enforce constraints to maintain data integrity, such as 
                primary keys, foreign keys and unique constraints. These constraints ensure that the data remains 
                accurate and consistent.
                <br><br>
                <b>SQL (Structured Query Language):</b> Relational databases use SQL as the standard language for 
                querying and manipulating data. SQL allows users to perform operations like SELECT, INSERT, 
                UPDATE and DELETE on the database.
                <br><br>
                Popular relational database management systems include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, 
                Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite. Relational databases are widely used in various applications, 
                ranging from business and finance to web development, due to their structured and efficient 
                data management capabilities.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><b>SQL - Structured Query Language</b></td>
              <td><b>SQL or Structured Query Language,</b> is a standardized programming language designed for managing 
                and manipulating relational databases. It serves as a means of communication between a user or 
                application and a relational database management system (RDBMS). SQL allows users to interact 
                with databases by defining, querying, updating and managing the data stored within them.
                <br><br>
                <u>Key features of SQL:</u>
                <br>
                <b>Data Querying:</b> SQL enables users to retrieve specific data from a database using the SELECT 
                statement. Queries can involve filtering, sorting and grouping data to meet specific requirements.
                <br><br>
                <b>Data Manipulation:</b> SQL provides statements such as INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE, allowing 
                users to add, modify or remove data from a database.
                <br><br>
                <b>Data Definition:</b> SQL includes commands like CREATE, ALTER and DROP to define and modify 
                the structure of database objects, such as tables, indexes and views.
                <br><br>
                <b>Data Control:</b> SQL supports commands for managing user permissions and access control, 
                ensuring data security and integrity.
                <br><br>
                SQL is used with various relational database management systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, 
                Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database and SQLite. Despite some variations in syntax among 
                different database systems, SQL's core concepts and functionality remain consistent, making it a 
                widely adopted and essential language for working with relational databases.</td>

            <tr>
              <td><b>ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)</b></td>
              <td>ACID, which stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability, is a set of properties 
                that ensure the reliability and integrity of transactions in a database management system (DBMS). 
                These principles are fundamental in maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data during 
                database operations.
                <br><br>
                <b>Atomicity:</b> This property ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible 
                unit. Either all the changes made by the transaction are committed to the database or none of 
                them are. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, leaving 
                the database in its original state.
                <br><br>
                <b>Consistency:</b> Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid 
                state to another. The database must adhere to predefined integrity constraints and if a 
                transaction violates these constraints, it is rolled back to maintain consistency.
                <br><br>
                <b>Isolation:</b> Isolation ensures that the execution of one transaction is isolated from the 
                execution of other transactions. Each transaction should appear as if it is executed in isolation, 
                regardless of concurrent transactions. This prevents interference or conflicts between transactions.
                <br><br>
                <b>Durability:</b> Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed and the changes 
                are saved to the database, they will persist, even in the event of system failures. The changes 
                become permanent and are not lost, providing a reliable and durable state for the database.
                <br><br>
                ACID properties are crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of database transactions, 
                especially in scenarios where multiple transactions may be executed concurrently. These properties 
                help ensure that database operations are robust and that the data remains accurate and consistent 
                over time.</td>

                systems that provide a flexible and non-relational approach to data storage and retrieval. 
                Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed schema with 
                predefined tables and relationships. Instead, they offer a more dynamic and scalable model, 
                making them suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
                <br><br>
                <u>Key characteristics of NoSQL databases:</u>
                <br>
                <b>Schema-less:</b> NoSQL databases are schema-less or schema-flexible, allowing for dynamic and 
                on-the-fly changes to the data model without requiring a predefined schema. This flexibility is 
                particularly useful in handling evolving and diverse data types.
                <br><br>
                <b>Scalability:</b> NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, allowing them to handle large 
                amounts of data and high traffic loads across multiple servers or nodes. This makes them 
                well-suited for distributed and parallel processing.
                <br><br>
                <b>Variety of Data Models:</b> NoSQL databases support various data models, including document-oriented 
                (e.g., MongoDB), key-value pairs (e.g., Redis), column-family (e.g., Apache Cassandra) and 
                graph-based (e.g., Neo4j). Each data model is optimized for specific types of applications and 
                data structures.
                <br><br>
                <b>High Performance:</b> NoSQL databases often prioritize performance and horizontal scalability, making 
                them suitable for use cases where rapid data retrieval and processing are critical.
                <br><br>
                <b>Non-relational:</b> NoSQL databases do not adhere to the traditional relational model with structured 
                tables and predefined relationships. This allows for more flexibility in handling complex and 
                dynamic data structures.
                <br><br>
                NoSQL databases are commonly used in scenarios where traditional relational databases may face 
                limitations, such as handling large-scale distributed systems, real-time data processing and 
                applications with constantly changing data models. They are well-suited for use in web applications, 
                big data analytics and other scenarios where flexibility and scalability are paramount.</td>

              <td>Graph databases are a type of NoSQL database that organizes and represents data using a 
                graph structure. In a graph database, data is modeled as nodes, edges and properties, 
                allowing for the representation and storage of complex relationships between entities. 
                This makes graph databases particularly well-suited for scenarios where relationships between 
                data points are crucial and need to be efficiently queried.
                <br><br>
                <u>Key concepts in graph databases:</u>
                <br>
                <b>Nodes:</b> Nodes represent entities in the graph, such as people, places or things. Each node can 
                have properties that define attributes of the entity.
                <br><br>
                <b>Edges:</b> Edges (also known as relationships or links) define connections between nodes, representing 
                the relationships between entities. Edges can also have properties to capture additional information 
                about the relationship.
                <br><br>
                <b>Properties:</b> Nodes and edges can have associated properties, which are key-value pairs providing 
                details or attributes about the entities or relationships.
                <br><br>
                Graph databases excel in scenarios where the relationships between data points are as important 
                as the data itself. Common use cases include social networks, fraud detection, recommendation 
                engines, network analysis and any application that involves navigating complex relationships.
                <br><br>
                Popular graph databases include Neo4j, Amazon Neptune and ArangoDB. These databases provide 
                efficient and expressive query languages for traversing and querying the graph structure, making 
                it easier to retrieve and analyze data based on the relationships between entities.
