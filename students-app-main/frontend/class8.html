        <h3>Command line interface - CLI</h3>
        <p>A command-line application, also known as a console application or command-line interface (CLI) 
          program, is a software application designed to be operated primarily through a <b>text-based 
          command-line interface</b> in a terminal or command prompt. <br>
          It is a text-based user interface that allows users to interact with a computer or software by 
          typing commands into a terminal or command prompt. It provides a direct and efficient way to 
          perform tasks, execute programs and manage system configurations using text commands rather 
          than graphical interfaces.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Node.js and vscode</h3>
        <p><b>Node.js</b> is a <b>runtime environment</b> that allows you to execute JavaScript code server-side. 
          It is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, the same engine that powers the Google Chrome browser.
          <br>
          It is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on the Chrome V8 
          JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling 
          server-side scripting for building scalable and efficient network applications. Node.js provides a 
          rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it popular for developing web servers, APIs and 
          real-time applications. <br>
          IDE: Integrated Development Environment
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Visual Studio Code (vscode)</b> is a free, open-source source code editor developed by Microsoft. 
          It provides a lightweight yet powerful environment for writing, editing and debugging code across 
          various programming languages. VSCode offers features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, 
          debugging support, version control integration and an extensive ecosystem of extensions to enhance 
          functionality and customization for developers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Dependencies</h3>
        <p>In the context of software development, dependencies refer to external modules, libraries or packages 
          that a software project relies on to function correctly. These dependencies are typically third-party 
          code or pre-built components that provide specific functionalities or services. They are used to 
          enhance the capabilities of a project, avoid reinventing the wheel and promote code reuse across 
          different applications.

        <img src="pictures/8.Application ports.png" alt="Applicaiton ports" style="height: 250px; float: right;">
        <h3>Application ports</h3>
        <p>A port is a communication endpoint that is used by protocols to identify a specific process or 
          service on a device
        </p>
        <p><b>Application ports,</b> often referred to simply as "ports," are numerical identifiers used to 
          differentiate between network services or processes running on a computer. In computer networking, 
          ports allow multiple applications or services to operate simultaneously on a single device by 
          assigning each one a unique port number. Ports are part of the addressing information used in the 
          transport layer of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. They enable communication between different 
          applications or services by specifying the source and destination endpoints of data transmission 
          within a network. Commonly used port numbers include 80 for HTTP (web servers), 443 for HTTPS 
          (secure web servers) and 22 for SSH (secure shell).
