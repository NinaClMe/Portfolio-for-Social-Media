        <p>I¬¥m Nina, 22 years old and study "Art and Multimedia" in my first semster at LMU Munich.</p>
        <p>In my free time I dance with the Perchalla carnival company.</p>
        <p>I also do volunteer work, I look after young people and teach them how to lead groups.
        Aside from that I¬¥m at UniKult and take care of the design there.</p>

        <h3>Programming language main concepts</h3>
        <img src="pictures/5.PLmC.png" alt="PLmC" style="height: 600px; float: right">
        <p>Programming languages have several fundamental concepts that are essential to understand when learning how 
          to write and understand code. Here are some of the main concepts:
          <br><br>
          <b>Variables:</b> Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program. They have a name and a value 
          and the value can change during the execution of the program.
          <br><br>
          <b>Data Types:</b> Programming languages support different types of data, such as integers, floating-point 
          numbers, strings (text), booleans (true/false) and more. Understanding data types is crucial for proper data 
          manipulation.
          <br><br>
          <b>Operators:</b> Operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values. Examples 
          include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, <, >) and logical operators (&&, ||).
          <br><br>
          <b>Control Flow:</b> Control flow statements determine the order in which instructions are executed.<br>
          Key control flow structures include:<br>
          <u>Conditional Statements:</u> If statements, switch statements, etc.<br>
          <u>Loops:</u> For loops, while loops, do-while loops, etc.<br>
          <u>Functions:</u> Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They take input 
          (parameters), perform operations and can return a result. Functions help in modularizing code and improving 
          code readability.
          <br><br>
          <b>Objects and Classes (OOP):</b> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that uses objects to 
          represent real-world entities. Objects have properties (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate 
          on those properties. Classes define the blueprint for creating objects.
          <br><br>
          <b>Arrays and Collections:</b> Arrays are data structures that store collections of elements, typically of 
          the same data type. Collections, such as lists or dictionaries, provide more advanced ways to organize and 
          manage data.
          <br><br>
          <b>Memory Management:</b> Understanding how memory is allocated and deallocated is crucial for managing 
          resources efficiently. Some languages handle memory automatically (e.g., garbage collection), while others 
          require manual memory management.
          <br><br>
          <b>Error Handling:</b> Programming languages provide mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions. This 
          includes try-catch blocks, error codes and other error-handling techniques.
          <br><br>
          <b>Syntax and Semantics:</b> Syntax refers to the rules governing the structure of code, while semantics 
          define the meaning of the code. Following correct syntax and understanding the semantics is essential for 
          writing valid and meaningful programs.
          <br><br>
          <b>Comments:</b> Comments are annotations in the code that are ignored by the compiler or interpreter. 
          They are used to provide explanations, document code and improve readability.
          <br><br>
          <b>File I/O (Input/Output):</b> Many programs interact with external files for reading input or writing output. 
          File I/O operations allow programs to read from and write to files.
          <br><br>
          These concepts form the foundation of programming and are applicable to various programming languages. 
          Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for writing clear, efficient and maintainable code.</p>
