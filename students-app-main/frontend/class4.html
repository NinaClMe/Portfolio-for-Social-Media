        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>CSS layouts</h3>
        <p>CSS layouts refer to the techniques and styles used to structure and position elements within a web 
          page using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Layouts play a crucial role in determining the visual 
          structure, flow and organization of content on a webpage.
          <p>CSS layouts refer to the way elements on a web page are structured and arranged, defining how 
            they appear in terms of their position, size and relationship to one another.</p>
          <br>
          <u>Key concepts and techniques related to CSS layouts:</u>
          <br>
          <b>Box Model:</b> The CSS box model represents elements as rectangular boxes, comprising content, padding, 
          borders and margins. Understanding and manipulating the box model is fundamental to creating 
          effective layouts.
          <br><br>
          <b>Positioning:</b> CSS provides positioning properties such as position, top, bottom, left and right to 
          control the placement of elements on a page. Common positioning values include static, relative, 
          absolute and fixed.
          <br><br>
          <b>Flexbox:</b> Flexbox is a CSS layout model that simplifies the design of flexible and responsive layouts. 
          It allows for the easy alignment and distribution of space among elements within a container.
          <br><br>
          <b>Grid Layout:</b> CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system that enables the creation of complex 
          grid-based designs. It allows for precise control over the placement and sizing of elements in both 
          rows and columns.
          <br><br>
          <b>Floats:</b> Floats are a traditional CSS layout technique that was commonly used for creating multi-column 
          layouts. While newer layout methods like Flexbox and Grid have become more popular, floats are still 
          encountered in certain situations.
          <br><br>
          <b>Responsive Design:</b> Responsive design involves creating layouts that adapt to different screen sizes 
          and devices. Techniques like media queries and flexible grid systems help achieve responsiveness.
          <br><br>
          <b>CSS Frameworks:</b> CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Foundation, provide pre-designed and customizable 
          layouts and components to streamline the process of building responsive and aesthetically pleasing 
          websites.
          <br><br>
          Understanding and applying CSS layouts are essential skills for web developers. Effective layouts 
          contribute to a positive user experience, improve readability and ensure that content is presented 
          in an organized and visually appealing manner across various devices and screen sizes.</p>

        <h3>Javascript</h3>
        <p>Programming is like teaching your computer how to do cool and fun things. <br>
          You use special languages (Javascript), like a secret code, to write these instructions. <br>
          The computer then follows these instructions step by step and that's how it does what you want it to do.
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is primarily used for adding interactivity and 
          dynamic behavior to websites. Let's break down some key aspects:
          <br><br>
          <b>Client-Side Scripting:</b> JavaScript is mainly executed on the client side, meaning it runs in web 
          browsers. This allows developers to manipulate the content of a webpage, respond to user interactions 
          and create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
          <br><br>
          <b>Scripting Language:</b> JavaScript is often referred to as a scripting language because it is 
          interpreted and executed line by line. This provides flexibility and ease of use, especially for tasks 
          related to web development.
          <br><br>
          <b>Dynamic Content:</b> JavaScript enables the creation of dynamic content on web pages. It can modify 
          the content of a webpage in real-time without requiring a full page reload. This is often used for 
          features like form validation, image sliders and updating content asynchronously.
          <br><br>
          <b>Event-Driven Programming:</b> JavaScript follows an event-driven programming model. Developers can 
          define functions (event handlers) that respond to events such as user clicks, form submissions and 
          keyboard interactions. This makes it possible to create interactive and responsive user interfaces.
          <br><br>
          <b>Variables and Data Types:</b> JavaScript supports variables, which are used to store and manipulate 
          data. It includes various data types like strings (text), numbers, booleans (true/false), objects, 
          arrays and more.
          <br><br>
          <b>Functions:</b> Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be defined and called to perform 
          specific tasks. Functions help in organizing code and making it more modular. They can take parameters 
          and return values.
          <br><br>
          <b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</b> JavaScript supports object-oriented programming principles.
          Objects can have properties (characteristics) and methods (functions) that allow for a more structured 
          and organized code.
          <br><br>
          <b>Asynchronous Programming:</b> JavaScript is often used for asynchronous programming, where tasks 
          can be performed in the background without blocking the execution of other code. This is commonly used 
          for tasks like fetching data from servers or handling user input.
          <br><br>
          <b>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</b> JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers, making it a 
          ubiquitous language for web development. It allows developers to write code that works consistently 
          across different browsers.
          <br><br>
          <b>Node.js:</b> While JavaScript is primarily known for client-side scripting, Node.js allows developers 
          to use JavaScript on the server side. This extends the language's capabilities to building scalable 
          and efficient server applications.
          <br><br>
          JavaScript is a fundamental technology in web development and is often complemented by HTML and CSS 
          to create engaging and interactive websites. The language has a large and active community and there 
          are numerous libraries and frameworks that enhance its functionality and ease of use.</p>
