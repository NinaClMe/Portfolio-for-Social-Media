        <p>I¬¥m Nina, 22 years old and study "Art and Multimedia" in my first semster at LMU Munich.</p>
        <p>In my free time I dance with the Perchalla carnival company.</p>
        <p>I also do volunteer work, I look after young people and teach them how to lead groups.
        Aside from that I¬¥m at UniKult and take care of the design there.</p>

        <h3>Version Control System</h3>
        <p><b>A Version Control System (VCS)</b> is a software tool that helps manage changes to source code or any 
          set of files over time. It is commonly used in collaborative software development to track and 
          coordinate changes made by multiple contributors to a project.
        </p>
        <p>It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by providing mechanisms 
          for storing, retrieving and comparing different versions of files. VCS helps teams to track changes, 
          maintain a history of revisions, resolve conflicts and revert to previous versions if needed. 
          It ensures consistency and integrity in code development and is essential for maintaining code
          quality and project management in software development. <br>
          Examples of VCS include Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial and Perforce.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>GIT/GitHub</h3>
        <p><b>Git:</b> is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows multiple developers to collaborate 
          on a project. <br>
          It is used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Developed by Linus Torvalds 
          in 2005, Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by managing revisions, 
          tracking history and facilitating teamwork through features like branching, merging and versioning. 
          It provides a decentralized workflow, enabling developers to work offline and synchronize changes with 
          remote repositories. Git is widely used in software development due to its speed, flexibility and 
          robustness.
        <br><br>
          <b>GitHub:</b> is a web-based platform that serves as aq hosting service for Git repositories. 
          It enhances the functionality of Git by adding a graphical interface, collaboration tools and 
          additional features.<br>
          It provides a collaborative environment for software developers to store, manage and share their 
          code projects. In addition to version control features offered by Git, GitHub offers additional 
          functionalities such as issue tracking, pull requests, code review, project management tools and 
          integration with various development tools and services. GitHub facilitates collaboration among 
          developers, teams and open-source communities, making it a popular platform for software development 
          and project management.

        <p>Everything you see here was created using the basic framework of the student app study case.</p>

        <h3>Javascript fetch method</h3>
        <p>The JavaScript Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (such as data or files) 
          asynchronously over the network. It allows you to make HTTP requests to servers and retrieve 
          data without having to reload the entire web page. The Fetch API uses Promises, making it easier 
          to work with asynchronous operations and handle responses in a more intuitive way.
          <br><br>
          <u>Here's a basic explanation of how the Fetch method works:</u><br>
          <b>Making a Request:</b> You use the Fetch method to initiate a request to a specified URL, 
          optionally providing configuration options such as request headers, request method (GET, POST, etc.) 
          and request body.
          <br><br>
          <b>Asynchronous Operation:</b> The Fetch method returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object 
          representing the result of the request. This allows you to handle the response asynchronously using 
          Promise-based syntax, such as using the then() method to process the response data.
          <br><br>
          <b>Handling the Response:</b> Once the request is complete, the Promise is resolved and you can 
          access the response data using methods like json() (to parse the response as JSON), text() 
          (to retrieve the response as plain text) or blob() (to retrieve the response as a binary object).
          <br><br>
          <b>Error Handling:</b> You can use the catch() method to handle errors that may occur during the 
          request process, such as network errors or server-side errors. This allows you to gracefully handle 
          failures and provide appropriate feedback to users.
          <br><br>
          Overall, the Fetch method provides a modern, powerful and flexible way to perform network requests 
          in JavaScript, making it easier to build dynamic and interactive web applications.
